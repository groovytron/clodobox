# Wetty

[`Wetty`](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/wetty) is a web based terminal.
It is useful when you want to ssh to your server from an organisation or
company whose firewall rules forbid connexions on ports different from `80`
(HTTP) or `443`(HTTPS). It's a trick to allow you to access a bash using
those ports.
