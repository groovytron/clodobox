Scripts and configuration templates for friends' server

# Wetty

[`Wetty`](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/wetty) is a web based terminal.
It is useful when you want to ssh to your server from an organisation or
company whose firewall rules forbid connexions on ports different from `80`
(HTTP) or `443`(HTTPS). It's a trick to allow you to access a bash using
those ports.

A good (and better) alternative is
[`sslh`](http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh/README.html) as it doesn't depend
on `nodejs`.

# Doom server

For the Doom fans, a friend created bash scripts for the last
[Zandronum server](https://wiki.zandronum.com/Main_Page).
Everything is in the `doomserv` folder.
They are here to give examples and to keep backup of his scripts.
